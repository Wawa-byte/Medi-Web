# Medi-Web
3rd Year Group Project

The website URL is: https://medi-check-76263.web.app

The website is built using Bootstrap studio.  

It is hosted using firebase and uses many firebases features such as:

Firebase Hosting: This is used to host the website <br>
FirebaseUI: This was used for the authentication of the user and allows them to sign in using a social media account. Which we choose to be Google. <br>
Realtime Database: We used this to store patient data, gp data, reviews and AI predictions 

Inside the assets folder there are folders for bootstrap files, CSS, images and JavaScript files
